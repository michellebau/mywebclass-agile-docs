As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.


Acceptance Criteria:
* The CI/CD pipeline should be integrated with the code repository so that code changes can be automatically triggered for building, testing, and deployment.
* The pipeline should automatically build the code changes to verify if there are any build failures or compilation errors.
* The pipeline should run all applicable unit tests to ensure that code changes are not introducing any errors or breaking existing functionality.
* The pipeline should perform a code quality check to ensure that code changes follow the best practices and standards.
* The pipeline should deploy the code changes to a staging environment, so that the changes can be tested further in a production-like environment.
* The pipeline should notify the developer of any build, test, or deployment failures, so that the issues can be resolved quickly.
* The pipeline should automatically rollback the changes to the last working version in case of any critical failures during deployment.
* The pipeline should provide visibility into the status of the code changes and pipeline stages, so that the developer can monitor and troubleshoot the pipeline if necessary.
