Task Title: Add error handling to the pipeline to notify the developer of any build, test, or deployment failures.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: This task involves adding error handling to the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that developers are notified promptly of any build, test, or deployment failures. The error handling mechanism should be integrated into the pipeline and configured to notify developers via email or a messaging platform such as Slack.

Effort Estimate: 4-6 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Identify the types of errors that should trigger notifications to developers, such as failed builds, test failures, or deployment issues.
* Choose a notification system that is appropriate for the project and the development team, such as email, Slack, or a combination of both.
* Configure the pipeline to integrate with the chosen notification system and send notifications to the appropriate developers or teams.
* Test the error handling mechanism to ensure that it is working correctly and notifications are being sent promptly and accurately.
* Create and maintain documentation that outlines the use and configuration of the error handling mechanism.
* Continuously monitor the notifications and refine the configurations as needed to ensure that the notifications are helpful and actionable for the developers.
