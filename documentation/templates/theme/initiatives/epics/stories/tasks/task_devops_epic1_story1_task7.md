Task Title: Implement automatic rollback procedures in case of any critical failures during deployment.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: This task involves implementing automatic rollback procedures in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that any critical failures during deployment are handled promptly and efficiently. The rollback procedures should be designed to automatically revert to the previous stable version of the application and notify the development team of the issue.

Effort Estimate: 6-8 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Identify the critical failure scenarios that would warrant an automatic rollback, such as system crashes or security breaches.
* Determine the rollback strategy and configure the pipeline to automatically execute the strategy when a critical failure occurs.
* Test the rollback procedures thoroughly to ensure that they work as expected and do not cause any further issues.
* Configure the pipeline to notify the development team of the rollback and the reason for it.
* Document the rollback procedures and ensure that all team members are aware of the process.
* Continuously monitor the deployment process and refine the rollback procedures as needed to ensure that they are effective in preventing or mitigating critical failures.
