Task Title: Configure the pipeline to provide real-time status updates and log information for monitoring purposes.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: This task involves configuring the CI/CD pipeline to provide real-time status updates and log information to enable monitoring and debugging of the pipeline. This includes setting up a monitoring dashboard that displays the status of each stage of the pipeline, as well as the logs generated by each stage.

Effort Estimate: 4-6 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Identify the key metrics that need to be monitored, such as build times, test pass rates, and deployment success rates.
* Configure the pipeline to generate and store logs for each stage of the pipeline, including build logs, test logs, and deployment logs.
* Set up a monitoring dashboard that displays the real-time status of each stage of the pipeline and the key metrics that need to be monitored.
* Ensure that the dashboard is accessible to all members of the development team and that it provides sufficient detail to enable effective monitoring and debugging of the pipeline.
* Continuously monitor the pipeline and refine the monitoring dashboard as needed to ensure that it provides accurate and actionable information for the development team.
* Ensure that the logs generated by the pipeline are stored securely and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
