Task Title: Implement changes to website layout and design to improve user experience, such as improving navigation, adding visual cues, or simplifying content.

User Story: As a project stakeholder, I want to ensure that the website is optimized for user experience and performance, so that learners can access and engage with the material easily and quickly.

Description: This task involves implementing changes to the website layout and design to improve the user experience. The changes could include improving the navigation by making it more intuitive and user-friendly, adding visual cues such as icons and graphics to guide the user, or simplifying the content by breaking it up into smaller, more manageable chunks. The changes should be based on user research and feedback, and should be tested to ensure that they improve the overall user experience of the website.

Effort Estimate: 
* The effort required for this task can vary depending on the scope and complexity of the changes that need to be made. A simple layout change could take a few hours, while a more complex redesign could take several days or even weeks. Here is a rough estimate of the effort required for different levels of complexity:
  * Simple layout changes: 4-8 hours 
  * Moderate redesign: 16-32 hours 
  * Complex redesign: 40-80 hours or more

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Factors that can affect the effort required include the size of the website, the number of pages that need to be redesigned, the level of detail required, and the tools and technologies used for implementation. It's important to allocate enough time and resources to thoroughly test the changes and ensure that they improve the user experience.
* Create wireframes and mockups: Once you have identified the changes you want to make, create wireframes and mockups to visualize the new layout and design. This will help you test and refine your ideas before implementing them.
* Test changes: Before implementing the changes, test them with real users to ensure that they improve the user experience. Use A/B testing or usability testing to gather feedback and make adjustments as needed.
* Implement changes: Once you have refined the changes based on user feedback, implement them in the website. Use best practices for web design and development, such as responsive design and accessibility standards, to ensure that the changes are effective and inclusive.
* Monitor performance: After implementing the changes, monitor the website's performance to ensure that the changes have improved the user experience. Use web analytics tools to track metrics such as bounce rate, time on page, and conversion rate, and make adjustments as needed.
