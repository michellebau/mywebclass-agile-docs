Task Title: Analyze website performance data to identify areas for improvement in site speed and load times.

User Story: As a project stakeholder, I want to ensure that the website is optimized for user experience and performance, so that learners can access and engage with the material easily and quickly.

Description: The task involves analyzing website performance data to identify areas for improvement in site speed and load times. This will include reviewing website analytics data, such as page load times, bounce rates, and user behavior, to identify any performance issues that may be impacting the user experience. The data analysis will be used to inform design and development decisions that will improve the website's performance.

Effort Estimate: As a rough estimate, this task can take anywhere between 10 to 30 hours to complete. 

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: Med-High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* The effort required for analyzing website performance data can vary depending on the complexity of the website and the amount of data to be analyzed. This includes reviewing website analytics data, identifying performance issues, prioritizing improvements, and creating a report with recommendations for improving site speed and load times. The time required may also vary based on the tools and software used for data analysis.
* Review website analytics data: Review website analytics data to identify areas of the website that may be causing slow load times or poor performance. This may include metrics such as page load times, bounce rates, and user behavior.
* Identify performance issues: Identify any performance issues that are impacting the user experience. This may include large images, slow server response times, or excessive use of JavaScript.
* Prioritize improvements: Prioritize improvements based on the impact they will have on the user experience and the resources required to implement them. Consider which improvements will have the biggest impact on the user experience and which are most feasible to implement.
* Create a plan for improvements: Create a plan for implementing the identified improvements. This may include optimizing images, implementing caching, or reducing the size of JavaScript files. Make sure to document the plan and communicate it with the development team.
* Monitor and test: After implementing improvements, continue to monitor and test website performance to ensure that the improvements are having the desired effect. Use website analytics data to track performance metrics and make further improvements as needed.
  * Automated testing involves using software tools to run tests and analyze performance data. Automated tests can be used to perform more complex and detailed performance tests, and can be especially useful for larger websites or for ongoing performance monitoring. Automated testing can also be more efficient and accurate than manual testing.
  * One popular tool for performance testing JavaScript-based applications is Lighthouse. The team can run a Lighthouse audit of a JavaScript-based application. This will generate a report that includes performance metrics, such as first contentful paint, time to interactive, and total blocking time.
  * Automated testing with tools like Lighthouse can help identify performance issues in JavaScript-based applications and provide specific recommendations for improving performance.
* Create a report: Create a report summarizing the findings from the website performance analysis and the recommended improvements. This report can be used to inform future website design and development decisions.
