Task Title: Set up a build server and configure it to build the code changes automatically.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: Set up a build server and configure it to automatically build any code changes triggered by the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This involves installing and configuring the necessary build tools and dependencies, setting up the build environment, and ensuring that the build process is automated and reproducible.

Effort Estimate: 4-8 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Determine which build server will be used for the project and ensure that it is compatible with the CI/CD pipeline being used.
* Install and configure the necessary build tools and dependencies on the build server, such as compilers, interpreters, and libraries.
* Ensure that the build environment is properly set up and all required configurations are in place for building the project.
* Automate the build process by setting up scripts or configurations that can be executed by the CI/CD pipeline.
* Verify that the build process is repeatable and that the generated artifacts are correct and complete.
* Monitor the build process for errors and warnings, and configure the pipeline to handle any failures that may arise.
* Document the build process and dependencies to ensure that it can be easily reproduced by other developers or on other build servers if needed.
