Task Title: Integrate a code quality tool into the pipeline to check the code changes against best practices and standards.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: This task involves integrating a code quality tool, such as SonarQube or ESLint, into the pipeline to analyze the code changes and provide feedback on adherence to coding standards and best practices. This helps to ensure that the code changes are maintainable, scalable, and of high quality.

Effort Estimate: 6-10 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Research and select a code quality tool that is suitable for the project and integrates well with the CI/CD pipeline being used.
* Configure the code quality tool to check for common issues and violations of best practices, such as code smells, duplication, and security vulnerabilities.
* Ensure that the code quality tool is properly integrated into the pipeline and is executing automatically on code changes.
* Review the output of the code quality tool and address any issues or violations that are identified.
* Create and maintain documentation that outlines the use of the code quality tool and the standards and practices it enforces.
* Continuously monitor the output of the code quality tool and refine the configurations as needed to improve the quality of the code base.
