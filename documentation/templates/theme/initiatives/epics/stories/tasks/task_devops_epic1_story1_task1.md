Task Title: Configure the code repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline on code changes.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: Configure the code repository to automatically trigger the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline whenever changes are made to the codebase. This involves setting up webhooks or other mechanisms to notify the pipeline of code changes, and ensuring that the pipeline is configured to respond appropriately to each notification.

Effort Estimate: 2-4 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Before configuring the code repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline, make sure that the pipeline is set up correctly and can respond appropriately to the code changes.
* Ensure that the appropriate permissions are in place to allow the code repository to notify the pipeline.
* Depending on the code repository being used, there may be different mechanisms available for triggering the pipeline. For example, some repositories support webhooks, while others may require a custom script to be written.
* It may be necessary to configure the pipeline to only respond to specific branches or types of code changes, depending on the requirements of the project.
* After configuring the pipeline, perform thorough testing to ensure that the pipeline is triggered correctly and the changes are processed as expected.
* Ensure that the pipeline is configured to handle any errors or issues that may arise during the processing of code changes, such as build failures or test errors.
