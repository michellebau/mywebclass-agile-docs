Task Title: Write unit tests for the code changes and ensure they are added to the test suite.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: This task involves creating unit tests for the code changes that have been made, as well as ensuring that the tests are properly integrated into the project's test suite. The unit tests should verify that the code changes are working as expected and that they do not introduce any new bugs or issues into the project.

Effort Estimate: 4-8 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Identify the areas of code that have been changed and determine which unit tests need to be created or updated.
* Write unit tests that cover the functionality added or modified by the code changes, and ensure that the tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases and error scenarios.
* Integrate the unit tests into the existing test suite, and ensure that the tests can be executed as part of the automated build and test process.
* Verify that the unit tests are passing and that they are detecting any issues or bugs introduced by the code changes.
* Refactor or update the unit tests as needed to ensure that they remain relevant and effective over time.
* Document the new unit tests and their purpose, to aid in future development and maintenance of the project.
