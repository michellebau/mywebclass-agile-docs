Task Title: Optimize website performance by compressing images, reducing code bloat, and improving server response times.

User Story: As a project stakeholder, I want to ensure that the website is optimized for user experience and performance, so that learners can access and engage with the material easily and quickly.

Description: This task involves optimizing the performance of the website by compressing images, reducing code bloat, and improving server response times. This can be achieved by using tools to compress images without losing quality, optimizing code to reduce its size and complexity, and improving server response times by optimizing server configurations, reducing network latency, and using content delivery networks (CDNs).

Effort Estimate: The effort required for this task can vary depending on the size and complexity of the website, the number of images and pages that need to be optimized, and the extent of server optimization required. Here is a rough estimate of the effort required for different levels of optimization:
* Basic optimization: 8-16 hours
* Moderate optimization: 16-32 hours
* Advanced optimization: 32-64 hours or more

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: Low

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Factors that can affect the effort required include the tools and technologies used for optimization, the level of expertise of the development team, and the extent of testing required to ensure that the optimizations do not negatively impact the user experience. It's important to allocate enough time and resources to thoroughly test the optimizations and ensure that they improve the overall performance of the website.
* Reduce code bloat: Remove unnecessary code, comments and whitespace from HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to reduce their file size. This can be done manually or using tools such as Grunt or Gulp.
* Minify code: Tools such as UglifyJS or Closure Compiler are available to minify JavaScript files and reduce their size. Minification removes unnecessary characters from the code and can improve the performance of the website.
* Improve server response times: Use server optimization techniques such as caching, compression, and Gzip compression to improve server response times. This can be achieved by configuring the web server to cache frequently accessed content, compressing responses, and using CDNs.
* Implement lazy loading: Lazy loading is a technique that loads images only when they are needed. This can significantly reduce the load time of web pages, especially for pages with a lot of images.
* Use a content delivery network (CDN): A CDN is a network of servers located in different parts of the world. By using a CDN, the website can serve content from the server closest to the user, reducing the load time and improving the performance of the website.
