Task Title: Create a staging environment for testing the code changes and configure the pipeline to deploy to it.

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

Description: This task involves creating a staging environment where the code changes can be deployed and tested before being promoted to the production environment. The staging environment should be as similar as possible to the production environment to ensure that any issues or bugs are caught early in the release process.

Effort Estimate: 8-12 hours

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* Identify the requirements for the staging environment, including the infrastructure and configuration needed to support the application.
* Create the staging environment, which may involve provisioning new servers or containers, configuring networking, and setting up databases.
* Configure the pipeline to deploy to the staging environment automatically on successful builds and tests.
* Verify that the application is running correctly in the staging environment and perform any necessary debugging or troubleshooting.
* Create and maintain documentation that outlines the use and configuration of the staging environment.
* Continuously monitor the performance and stability of the staging environment and refine the configurations as needed to improve the quality of the testing environment.
