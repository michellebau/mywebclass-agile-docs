Implement security and compliance controls

Description: The goal of this epic is to implement security and compliance controls in the CI/CD pipeline for the website created to teach software engineering skills to educators. This will involve identifying potential security risks and implementing measures to mitigate them, as well as ensuring that the website complies with relevant laws and regulations. By implementing these controls, we can ensure that the website is secure and compliant with industry standards and regulations, while also providing educators with a safe and reliable platform for teaching software engineering skills. This epic will be closely related to other epics under the initiative "Continuous Integration and Delivery", as security and compliance controls will need to be integrated into the overall CI/CD pipeline to ensure that updates are released quickly, reliably, and with high quality.

Goals:
1. Ensure that the website is secure and protected against potential security threats.
2. Ensure that the website is compliant with relevant laws and regulations.
3. Minimize the risk of data breaches or other security incidents.
4. Provide educators with a safe and reliable platform for teaching software engineering skills.

User Stories:
* As a developer, I want to implement secure coding practices and perform regular security audits to ensure that the website is secure and protected against potential security threats.
* As a compliance officer, I want to ensure that the website complies with relevant laws and regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA.

Dependencies:
* Integration with the overall CI/CD pipeline: Security and compliance controls will need to be integrated into the overall CI/CD pipeline to ensure that updates are released quickly, reliably, and with high quality.
* Compliance regulations: Compliance regulations can change over time, so it will be important to stay up to date and ensure that the website remains compliant with relevant laws and regulations.
* Data protection policies: Data protection policies will need to be established and enforced to ensure that students' personal information and data is handled in a secure and responsible manner.

Risks:
1. Security breaches: Despite implementing security controls, there is always a risk of security breaches or other security incidents that could compromise the website and students' personal information.
2. Compliance violations: Failure to comply with relevant laws and regulations could result in fines, legal action, and damage to the reputation of the website and the organization.

Mitigation Strategies:
1. Regular security audits: Perform regular security audits to identify potential security risks and implement measures to mitigate them.
2. Stay up to date with compliance regulations: Stay informed about changes to relevant laws and regulations and update the website as needed to remain compliant.
3. Implement data protection policies: Establish and enforce data protection policies to ensure that any personal information and data collected from users is handled in a secure and responsible manner.

Estimated Effort:
* Conduct security audit and implement security controls: 20-40 hours
* Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations: 15-25 hours
* Establish and enforce data protection policies: 10-20 hours

Business Value: Implementing security and compliance controls in the CI/CD pipeline for the website created to teach software engineering skills to educators can bring significant business value to the organization in the following ways:
* Protecting the website and user data: Implementing security controls will safeguard the website against potential security threats, such as hacking, phishing, or malware attacks, and ensure the safety and integrity of user data. This can increase user trust and confidence in the website, leading to increased usage and adoption.
* Compliance with regulations: Ensuring that the website complies with relevant laws and regulations can help avoid legal penalties and fines, as well as reputational damage. Compliance can also increase user trust and confidence in the website, leading to increased usage and adoption.
* Cost savings: Implementing security and compliance controls in the CI/CD pipeline can help minimize the risk of data breaches or other security incidents, which can be costly to remediate. By investing in security and compliance upfront, organizations can avoid potential costs associated with remediation, such as legal fees, lost revenue, and damaged reputation.
* Improved reputation: Providing educators with a safe and reliable platform for teaching software engineering skills can enhance the organization's reputation as a trusted provider of high-quality educational resources. This can lead to increased customer loyalty, word-of-mouth referrals, and improved brand recognition.
* Overall, implementing security and compliance controls in the CI/CD pipeline for the website created to teach software engineering skills to educators can bring significant business value to the organization by improving security, compliance, cost savings, and reputation.

Priority: High
