Set up the initial CI/CD pipeline infrastructure

Description: The goal of this epic is to set up the initial infrastructure required for a Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automates testing, deployment, and delivery of the website. This includes setting up build servers and integration tools, configuring automated deployment and release management tools, and establishing the basic framework for the pipeline.

Goals:
* Set up a robust and scalable infrastructure that supports the pipeline
* Establish automated build, integration, deployment, and release management tools
* Configure the pipeline to be flexible and adaptable to changing requirements

User Stories:
* As a developer, I want to be able to submit code changes to the pipeline, so that my code can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.
* As a project manager, I want to be able to track the progress of the pipeline and its components, so that I can ensure that the pipeline is on track to meet its goals and deadlines.

Dependencies:
* Availability of suitable build servers and integration tools that are compatible with the pipeline
* Access to a reliable and scalable infrastructure that can support the pipeline
* Availability of skilled DevOps engineers who can configure and manage the pipeline
* Availability of suitable deployment and release management tools that are compatible with the pipeline

Risks:
1. Lack of expertise in setting up and configuring a CI/CD pipeline could lead to delays or errors in implementation.
2. Integration challenges between different tools or components of the pipeline could cause delays or errors in the pipeline.
3. Inadequate or incorrect infrastructure could cause performance or scalability issues for the pipeline.
4. Unforeseen technical or compatibility issues with the pipeline tools could cause delays or errors in implementation.

Mitigation Strategies:
1. Provide training and support for DevOps engineers who are new to setting up a CI/CD pipeline.
2. Use standardized tools and processes to ensure seamless integration between different components of the pipeline.
3. Conduct thorough testing and evaluation of the infrastructure before implementation to ensure scalability and reliability.
4. Conduct thorough testing and evaluation of the pipeline tools and components before implementation to identify and mitigate potential issues early on.

Estimated Effort: a few dozen to a few hundred hours, depending on the complexity of the project

Business Value: Overall, the business value of setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a small website can still be significant, as it can help to improve website performance, reduce errors, and increase collaboration and efficiency within the development team. Some potential benefits could include:
* Improved website quality and user experience
* Reduced risk of errors and bugs in the production environment
* Faster delivery of new features and updates to users
* Increased collaboration and communication between development, operations, and quality assurance teams

Priority: High
