Establish testing automation for the pipeline

Description: The goal of this epic is to establish testing automation for the CI/CD pipeline, in order to ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested and validated before being deployed to the production environment. By automating the testing process, we can reduce the risk of errors and bugs in the production environment and ensure that updates are released quickly, reliably, and with high quality.

Goals:
* Identify and define the different types of tests that need to be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.
Select and implement testing tools and frameworks that are compatible with the pipeline and meet the needs of the testing strategy.
Define and document the testing processes and workflows that will be used as part of the pipeline.
Develop and execute automated tests as part of the pipeline to validate code changes and ensure that they meet quality standards.
Ensure that test results are recorded and communicated effectively to the development team, so that issues can be addressed in a timely manner.
Continuously monitor and improve the testing process to ensure that it remains effective and efficient over time.

User Stories: 
* As a developer, I want to be able to write automated tests for my code changes, so that I can ensure that my changes don't introduce new bugs or issues.
* As a QA tester, I want to be able to run automated tests as part of the pipeline, so that I can identify any issues or bugs before they are deployed to the production environment.

Dependencies:
* Availability of suitable testing tools and frameworks that are compatible with the pipeline.
* Access to a comprehensive suite of test cases that can be used to validate code changes.
* Integration with other tools and systems used as part of the CI/CD pipeline, such as version control, deployment, and monitoring tools.

Risks: (edit later)
* Risk: Incomplete or inadequate test coverage, which could lead to errors or bugs being introduced into the production environment.
* Mitigation: Develop a comprehensive test plan and suite of test cases that cover all key functionality and use cases of the website or application.
* Risk: Technical incompatibilities between testing tools and the pipeline, which could cause delays or errors in the testing process.
* Mitigation: Ensure that all testing tools and frameworks are compatible with the pipeline, and conduct thorough testing and validation before integrating them into the pipeline.
* Risk: Lack of expertise or experience in testing automation, which could result in suboptimal testing processes or tools being used.
* Mitigation: Provide training and support to team members to help them develop their skills in testing automation, and leverage external resources or consultants as needed to ensure that best practices are being followed.

Estimated Effort: a few dozen to a few hundred hours, considering the complexity of the website or application, the types of tests that need to be run, the testing tools and frameworks that are selected, and the existing testing infrastructure and processes

Business Value: Establishing testing automation for the pipeline can provide significant business value by reducing the risk of errors and bugs being introduced into the production environment, and by increasing the speed and efficiency of the testing and deployment process. By automating the testing process, the team can ensure that updates are released quickly, reliably, and with high quality, which can lead to increased customer satisfaction, improved user experience, and greater overall business agility. The business value of this epic will depend on the specific goals and priorities of the organization, but in general, it can be considered a high-value initiative that can help to improve the overall quality and reliability of the website or application.

Priority: High
